<!-- Assignment 1: Fusion 360 Tutorial -->
<hr style="border-top: dotted 5px;">
<h1>Assignment I: Fusion 360 Tutorial</h1>
<h6>Following a Fusion 360 tutorial in order to help us grasp the dexterity of Fusion 360 was the first part of our 2D Design and Cutting assignment. I chose to attempt <a style="color: #0645AD" href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/02_cutting/index.html">Dr. Melenbrink's square demo.</a></p></h6>
First, make a 40mm x 40mm square
![Square Demo in Fusion 360](images/2D_Design/firststep.png)
<br><br>Select all sides of the square and offset by -10.0 mm to create smaller square and make a perpendicular construcion-line at the midpoint for all sides.
![Square Demo in Fusion 360](images/2D_Design/secondstep.png)
<br><br>Offset said perpendicular line by half the thickness of the material.
![Square Demo in Fusion 360](images/2D_Design/2D_Designthirdstep.png)
<br><br>Use the mirror tool to mirror to the other side of the construcion-line.
![Square Demo in Fusion 360](images/2D_Design/fourthstep.png)
<br><br>Delete your construcion-lines and extrude by 4.0mm

<br><br>And Voila!

<!-- Assignment 2: Modeling Houshold Objects -->
<h1>Assignment II: Modeling Houshold Objects</h1>
<h6>Next, students had to choose a minimum of two houshold items and model them in Fusion 360. For my two objects, I chose to 3D model a tape roll and an iPhone.</h6>
<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">iPhone Design Process</h5>
<br>
First I measured the iPhone's thickness, length, width, display length, display width, iPhone notch length, iPhone notch width.

After a bit of CAD work, we have a 3D model of an iPhone

<!-- Assignment 3: Creating a Press-Fit Construction Kit -->
<h1>Assignment III: Creating a Press-Fit Construction Kit</h1>
<h6>For this final part of the assignment, the goal was to "create a press-fit construction kit that can be assembled in multiple ways and accounts for laser cutter kerf". I went through many stages/learning opportunities before reaching the final result. Lets's go through them. Shall we?</h6>
<br>
<br>
<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Attempt #1: The Hexagone ‚è∫Ô∏è</h5>
<br>
First, design. I used Fusion 360's skectch tool to create a 6-sided polygone (hexagon). I then made three 5mm x 10mm notches on every side of the shape.
![Image of a Hexagon: Dimensions](images/2D_Design/hexdimen.png)
![Image of Hexagon: First Attempt](images/2D_Design/hexagone.png)
<br>
<br>

Now...Printing!
![Image of Laser Cutter](images/2D_Design/lasercuthex.jpg)
<p1>My first cut was a hexagonal gear mechanism that could be used to create objects like balls, specifically a soccer ball. My choice to include an excessive amount of notches rendered my design un-attachable as the vertices of the hexagon along with the placement of my notches interfered with the intended desired attachment of the pieces. My failure to remember the measuring of the kerf further amplified the fact that this idea was in desperate need of improvement. </p1>
<br>
<hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
<br>
<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Attempt #2: Sqaure, Triangle, Pentagon ‚èπÔ∏è</h5>
![Image of Pentagon, Square, Triangle](images/2D_Design/attempt2.png)
![Image of Space between Notches](images/2D_Design/spacebetween.png)
<br><br>
Although there were many sad feelings with the first hexagon attempt, there was still some crucial information learned...one of them being the kerf. Using a caliper to measure the cardboard cutout of the shape turned out to an average of 50.455 which, when subtracted by 49.545 - the shape itself - turns out to a kerf of 0.91mm. Doesn't look right? That's because it isn't! While a step forward as opposed to last time, this miscalculation in the kerf led to the area between the notches to be to small resulting in the inability to fit the pices together as they were too tight for each other. What a bummer...

<hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />
<br><br>
<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Final Attempt: Triangle üîº</h5>
<p1>Remeasuring the kerf, it came out to a more reasonable 0.365mm. Using this new information, I hopped onto Fusion 360 and started to sketch my final design...a triangle. I first started by taping the "skectch" button. I then chose the "edge polygon" from the polygon menu under the create menu starting from 0,0 on the coordinate plane and onto 150,0 signifiying that the triangle would be 150mm. Following that, I chose entered 3 as the number of sides the polygon should have. Furthermore, I made a perpendicular construction line at the midpoint for all three sides of the triangle. I then offset said construction-line and knowing that the thickness of the cardboard was 4.4 mm, I subtracted half of said thickness (2.2mm) by the kerf measurement in order to compensate for the "laser dust" when making notch. Repeat on all 3 sides, extrude by 4.4mm, fillet interior edges by 3mm and outer edges by 1.5mm and you got yourself a shape!</p1>

<br><br>
One Triangle

<br><br><br>
Two Triangles. Fit together tightly whilst still being easy to separate.

<br><br><br>
Or get 12 triangles and cut out a 30cm x 30cm cardboard square and...

Make a Table that can support a laptop!
